The program is only tested on Windows 10.
Before you use the program it would be the best to create a virtual environment and install all required modules in it.
You can use the following commands for Windows 10 to do this:
```
python -m venv venv
cd venv/Scripts
activate
pip install cffi comtypes cryptography pycparser pywifi
```
